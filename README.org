** Warning 1!

This package is still in the early stages of active development. While I am
currently using it daily, it should be considered as still in an alpha
stage. This means that the public interface can and likely will change!  Also,
due to the nature of dynamic modules dealing with memory directly, bugs can mean
segfaults, memory leaks, and ultimately untimely crashes. So beware that data
loss may result! However, if you do experience crashes, please report it!

** Warning 2!

Browsers are a big target of malware and as such ensuring you're running the
most up to date version that receives security patches is essential. It is up to
you to ensure you are running an up to date version of webkitgtk2. Note that not
every distro consistently and quickly updates webkitgtk2 in its package
repos. The WebKitGTK team publishes releases and security advisories [[https://webkitgtk.org/news.html][here]].

Running a browser capable of javascript execution inside Emacs is potentially
scary since inside Emacs, all code is trusted and usually has unrestricted
access to your system. This is somewhat mitigated by webkitgtk2 using a
multiprocess model where website's content and scripts run in a separate process
from UI, which in this case is Emacs. I'll make every effort to ensure that
potentially malicious JavaScript cannot remotely execute arbitrary lisp, however
my trust model will always treat user lisp code as trusted. Furthermore I make
no grantees about the overall security of ~emacs-webkit~.

* Background

I've found that the only two applications I regularly have open are Emacs and a
browser. Emacs is a joy to use while I feel like I'm constantly fighting my
browser. I used to be pretty happy with Firefox and vimperator however since
Project Quantum came to FF 57+, I haven't been satisfied with the extensibility
or speed of the WebExtension replacements. There are a few keyboard driven,
extensible browser projects such as qutebrowser, LuaKit, vimb, surf,
etc.... Unfortunately given the complexity of the "modern" web, they all have to
be based off of either the Blink (through QtWebEngine) or WebKit (through
WebKitGTK) browser engines (I really wish Mozilla would put more effort into
making a clean and maintained API for embedding the latest Gecko with rust
components, i.e. servo). I shy away from Blink based browsers out of principles
of wanting to avoid Google and the browser monoculture and also because the only
easy way to embed Blink is through QtWebEngine and I don't really like Qt all
that much.

An attempt at adding a webkitgtk widget to Emacs with the experimental
~xwidgets~ feature [[https://github.com/jave/xwidget-emacs][was made many years ago]] and has received pretty minimal
development over the years. I think it isn't for lack of interest in the
concept, but rather the difficulty of understanding the complicated dance that
is Emacs redisplay and how xwidgets hacked themselves into that. Also the
"politics" of having a full featured browser inside Emacs core that can
potentially execute non-free javascript usually means much discussion on
emacs-devel when trying to add new features. I figured that perhaps such a
feature could be implemented instead as a dynamic module. This has the advantage
of a clearer separation between Emacs' display handling and webkit's, hopefully
making it easier to workout the inevitable bugs that occur when forcing them to
coexist. This also allows features and fixes to be developed outside of Emacs
core with less concern for supporting all the platforms and environments that
Emacs needs to work with, while also avoiding some of the "political tensions".

~emacs-webkit~ now has all of the features that the ~webkit xwidget~ has, plus
more, such as integrating some features from [[https://github.com/canatella/xwwp][~xwwp~]]. I was also able to add
experimental support for opening an non-embedded, dedicated webkit window. In
principle this allows running ~emacs-webkit~ on a tty as webkit popus up its own
window (of course one needs a graphical session to be running, i.e. ~$DISPLAY~
needs to be set). In testing this, I've found there will always be behavior out
of Emacs' control due to the window being at the mercy of the window manager, so
things like focusing end up wonky and harder to control. To try this out: ~(setq
webkit-own-window t)~.

** But what about the Emacs Application Framework (EAF)?

While I think its neat what EAF has been able to do, I personally have less of a
desire to dive into its code due to its reliance on Qt (and hence Blink for its
browser component) and python, and I suspect this may be a barrier for others as
well. Furthermore, I don't think it has a technical path forward to natively
work on Wayland due to its current reliance on the XEmbed protocol. My goal with
~emacs-webkit~ was to have something that will work with pgtk port of Emacs (in
fact I primarily developed it on Wayland running pgtk Emacs).

** But what about nyxt?

I think nyxt is certainly a cool project and I wish them the best! However, I
would say this project is for the Emacs user like me who begrudgingly uses a
modern web browser but wishes they didn't have to. I wish I could make eww my
default browser but it just very often doesn't cut it due to the unfortunate
world of "modern" javascript and "web apps". In contrast, I would say nyxt is
more for the lisp aficionado who wishes the web ran lisp instead of javascript
and the Emacs user who wishes Emacs' underlying UI paradigm looked more like the
web's DOM. I believe the nyxt developers want nyxt to essentially be a common
lisp emacs. It is a massive undertaking and will take time for them to build an
ecosystem like the one Emacs has developed over the decades. I've thought about
how I could make nyxt integrate with Emacs in a way I would be happy with and
I've found that while it is certainly possible to do so given nyxt's
extensibility, I felt like there would always be some friction. For example
who's UI should I use? Do I integrate Emacs buffer list into nyxt's minibuffer
or nyxts buffer list into Emacs? Finally I wanted an excuse to dig more into
Emacs' C guts and this project has given me a lot of chances to do so.

* Installation

Once things stabilize a bit, I'll probably package this for MELPA.

~emacs-webkit~ requires at least Emacs 28

Make sure you have gcc, pkg-config, gtk3, glib-networking, and of course
webkitgtk installed. Then just run ~make~ to make ~webkit-module.so~.

Some package managers support custom build steps to automate building. For
example with the latest [[https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el/][straight.el]] you can use this recipe

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(straight-use-package
 '(webkit :type git :host github :repo "akirakyle/emacs-webkit"
          :branch "main"
          :files (:defaults "Makefile" "*.h" "*.c" "*.js" "*.css")
          :build ("make")))
#+end_src

I'm a bit hesitant to add lisp code to do this automagically or fetch prebuilt
modules from the web like ~pdf-tools~ or ~emacs-libvterm~, because I'm a
believer that it should be the job of a package manager, but perhaps I'll be
convinced otherwise.

* Setup

First ensure ~emacs-webkit~ is on your ~load-path~.

** Manually

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(require 'webkit) 
(global-set-key (kbd "s-b") 'webkit) ;; Bind to whatever global key binding you want if you want
#+end_src

** ~use-package~

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package webkit
  :bind ("s-b" 'webkit) ;; Bind to whatever global key binding you want if you want
  )
#+end_src

* Usage

- ~M-x webkit~
- Enter url or keywords to search
- ~C-h m~ (~describe-mode~) to see keybindings.
- Feel the power (and weight) of a browser running inside Emacs.

~emacs-webkit~ has a concept of an "insert" mode, which moves keyboard focus to
the ~webview~ from Emacs. This means the webview will see all key-presses and
Emacs will only see the modifier keypresses that are unhandled by the
webview. This is useful for typing in a text box or using the keyboard shortcuts
a website might set up. To return focus back to Emacs use ~C-g~. Some
~emacs-webkit~ features might have a javascript component that requires moving
to insert mode. Sometimes javascript is buggy or crashes in which case you may
be left surprised that Emacs isn't responding to you. ~C-g~ is, as always, your
friend here.

~webkit-start-web-inspector~ will start webkit's built in dev tools. Beware that
the handling of focus can be pretty wonky.

* Customization

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; If you don't care so much about privacy and want to give your data to google
(setq webkit-search-prefix "https://google.com/search?q=") 

;; Specify a different set of characters use in the link hints
;; For example the following are more convienent if you use dvorak
(setq webkit-ace-chars "aoeuidhtns")

;; If you want history saved in a different place or
;; Set to `nil' to if you don't want history saved to file (will stay in memory)
(setq webkit-history-filename "~/path/to/webkit-history") 

;; See the above explination in the Background section
;; This must be set before webkit.el is loaded so certain hooks aren't installed
(setq webkit-own-window t) 

;; Set webkit as the default browse-url browser
(setq browse-url-browser-function 'webkit-browse-url)

;; Force webkit to always open a new session instead of reusing a current one
(setq webkit-browse-url-force-new t)

;; Disable javascript
(add-hook 'webkit-new-hook #'webkit-enable-javascript)

;; Override the "loading:" mode line indicator with an icon from `all-the-icons.el'
;; You could also use a unicode icon like ↺
(defun webkit--display-progress (progress)
  (setq webkit--progress-formatted
        (if (equal progress 100.0)
            ""
          (format "%s%.0f%%  " (all-the-icons-faicon "spinner") progress)))
  (force-mode-line-update))
#+end_src

I personally use evil so I've included ~evil-collection~ bindings which I hope
to upstream at some point when things stabilize.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package evil-collection-webkit
  :config
  (evil-collection-xwidget-setup)
  )
#+end_src
